This project implements a deep learning solution for classifying characters from the popular TV show "The Simpsons" using PyTorch.

## Project Description
The goal is to accurately classify images of Simpsons characters into 42 different categories. The solution uses transfer learning with a ResNet50 backbone, achieving high accuracy through careful data preprocessing and model tuning.

## Key Features
- Automated class detection from directory structure
- Comprehensive image transformations and augmentations
- Training/validation split (80%/20%)
- Progress tracking with tqdm
- Multiple evaluation metrics (Loss, Accuracy, F1-Score)
- Learning rate scheduling
- GPU acceleration support

## The accuracy of the assessment is achieved up to 90 percent
